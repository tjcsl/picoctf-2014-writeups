ExecuteMe is quite easy.

All you need to do is provide to the program shellcode to spawn a bash process.
Because the program just runs the buffer anyway, no special work is required.
I just Googled for execve shellcode and used the first result (incidentally,
this is the same shellcode I used for basically every other similar problem)
