So, I feel like I didn't actually solve this one the correct way because the
problem hint had no bearing at all on my solution, but whatever.

This problem was basically trivial, as I recall.

All you need to do I provide a command line argument of length > 64 such that
the argument contains shellcode to run /bin/sh or what have you, as well as
the necessary values to overwrite the return address of the vuln stack frame
to return into your shellcode and run it.

It's probably not the right way, but it got me the flag...
